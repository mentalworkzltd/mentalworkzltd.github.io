Testing and previewing transactional emails with actual data can be tricky and time consuming. This module allows you to easily preview frontend transactional emails via the admin with real data, and send test emails to your email client(s).

This module is compatible with Magento version 2.3+ (Untested on lower versions, but should be fine).
